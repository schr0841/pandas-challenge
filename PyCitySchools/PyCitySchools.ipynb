    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",

    "-To receive all points, the written report presents a cohesive written analysis that:\n",

    "Summary: We collected information about students in our local school district for analysis. There is a fairly large difference in the percentage of students passing both math and reading at the various high schools - the lowest is Rodriguez High School at 52.988247 percent, while the highest was Cabrera High School with 91.334769 percent. This means that achievement depends heavily on school name. From looking at the table of highest-performing and lowest-performing schools, it seems like there is a group of schools in the 90's as well as the 50's. As a result, we may label some schools high-performing and some schools low-performing. Further analysis on this disparity is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first goal is to see if there is a correlation between student success and funding. For this, we can use the per_school_summary dataframe to see if there is a relationship. For each school, the percent passing seems to decrease with an increase in spending per student. Looking at the spending_summary dataframe, we can see the same pattern. This is counterintuitive, so more investigation is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second goal is to see if there are other patterns that affect learning outcomes. Perhaps the issue is not funding, but rather the type of school. From examining the type_summary dataframe, we can see that type plays a heavy role, as charter schools have much higher student success rates than district schools. This may also be linked to school size, as charter schools tend to be smaller in terms of student population than district schools. The small to medium size charter schools seem to have much higher overall success rates than the large district schools (90% to 50% success rate disparity).\n",
